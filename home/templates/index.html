        <h1>Storytelling</h1>
        <p>The weapon of mass attraction is the ability to communicate. I wish I’d figured
            this out earlier: Money, mates, and meaning are all moths to the flame of storytelling.
            I’m on a flight from London to LA, where I’ll kick off a six-city tour (then to San Diego,
            Seattle, Austin, NYC, and Miami). In each city, I’ll stand in front of several hundred
            people with a hundred-plus charts peering down from behind. Then I’ll tell stories. My
            favorite part is the Q&A, which is a real test of skills. Plus, people are, generally,
            wonderful. Most are (offline) super nice and ask a question that reveals something about
            themselves, and we all feel closer. One query I get often is “What class/skill would you
            suggest our kids take/learn to compete in the modern economy?” Or some-such. I think most
            expect me to say computer science, STEM courses, or some bullshit about the wonders of a
            liberal arts education that foments curiosity. But hands down, the skill I would grant my
            boys is singular: storytelling.. </p>
